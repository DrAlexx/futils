# futils
For a long time of the my work in the different projects I have cought some situations when standard library or boost library haven't got needed functional.
This library is a collection of code that was made in the such situations.

There are:
- Profiler - is a template-based in-source profiler. 
- BitStreamAdaptor - is an template adaptor that can adapt any secunce to the bit-stream
- RLUCache - is a map based container with the possibility to purge old items by the user tuned policy.
- ShardMap - is a template that helps to grow up map [performance in multithreading apps.
- BinaryTree - is a template AVL tree that has non-recursive insert/erase implementations.
